								In addition, I have experience using weak gravitational lensing to examine low surface brightness galaxies 
								and to perform cosmological measurements for the DELVE survey. Outside of science, I love ballet, aerial silks,
								baking, scuba diving, and hiking.

								<b>Weak Gravitational Lensing around Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in the DES Y3 Data </b><br>
								<a href="https://astro.theoj.org/article/124536-weak-gravitational-lensing-around-low-surface-brightness-galaxies-in-the-des-year-3-data">Chicoine, et al. (2024)</a>
								We present galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements using a sample of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) drawn from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (Y3) data as lenses. LSBGs are diffuse galaxies with a surface brightness dimmer than the ambient night sky. These dark-matter-dominated objects are intriguing due to potentially unusual formation channels that lead to their diffuse stellar component. Given the faintness of LSBGs, using standard observational techniques to characterize their total masses proves challenging. Weak gravitational lensing, which is less sensitive to the stellar component of galaxies, could be a promising avenue to estimate the masses of LSBGs. 
								Our LSBG sample consists of 23,790 galaxies separated into red and blue color types at and $(g-1\ge 6)$ and (g-i\le 5)$, respectively. Combined with the DES Y3 shear catalog, we measure the tangential shear around these LSBGs and find signal-to-noise ratios of 6.67 for the red sample, 2.17 for the blue sample, and 5.30 for the full sample. We use the clustering redshifts method to obtain redshift distributions for the red and blue LSBG samples. Assuming all red LSBGs are satellites, we fit a simple model to the measurements and estimate the host halo mass of these LSBGs to be 
								$\log(\frac{M_\mathrm{host}}{M_{\odot}}) = 12.98^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$. We place a 95% upper bound on the subhalo mass at $\log(\frac{M_\mathrm{sub}}{M_{\odot}}) < 11.51$. By contrast, we assume the blue LSBGs are centrals, and place a 95% upper bound on the halo mass at $\log(\frac{M_\mathrm{host}}{M_{\odot}}) <11.84$. We find that the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of the LSBG samples is consistent with that of the general galaxy population. This work illustrates the viability of using weak gravitational lensing to constrain the halo masses of LSBGs.

								<b>The DECADE cosmic shear project III: validation of analysis pipeline using spatially inhomogeneous data</b><br>
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250217676A/abstract">Anbajagane, et al. (2025)</a>
								We present the pipeline for the cosmic shear analysis of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog consisting of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. The catalog derives from a large number of disparate observing programs and is therefore more inhomogeneous across the sky compared to existing lensing surveys. First, we use simulated data-vectors to show the sensitivity of our constraints to different analysis choices in our inference pipeline, including sensitivity to residual systematics. 
								Next we use simulations to validate our covariance modeling for inhomogeneous datasets. Finally, we show that our choices in the end-to-end cosmic shear pipeline are robust against inhomogeneities in the survey, by extracting relative shifts in the cosmology constraints across different subsets of the footprint/catalog and showing they are all consistent within  1σ to  2σ. 
								This is done for forty-six subsets of the data and is carried out in a fully consistent manner: for each subset of the data, we re-derive the photometric redshift estimates, shear calibrations, survey transfer functions, the data vector, measurement covariance, and finally, the cosmological constraints. Our results show that existing analysis methods for weak lensing cosmology can be fairly resilient towards inhomogeneous datasets. This also motivates exploring a wider range of image data for pursuing such cosmological constraints.
